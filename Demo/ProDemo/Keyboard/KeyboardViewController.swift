/**
 This keyboard demonstrates how to create a keyboard that is
 using a `SystemKeyboard` to mimic a native keyboard that is
 using KeyboardKit Pro to unlock several localized keyboards.
 
 The keyboard makes demo-specific configurations and sets up
 the keyboard with a ``KeyboardView``. You can change all of
 these configurations to see how the keyboard changes.
 
 The keyboard registers a Pro license to unlock all keyboard
 locales, then applies either LTR or RTL locales based on if
 you are using the `Keyboard` or `KeyboardRTL` keyboard. The
 keyboard lets you change locale with a separate button that
 is inserted by the ``DemoKeyboardLayoutProvider``.
 
 To use this keyboard, you must enable it in system settings
 ("Settings/General/Keyboards"). It needs full access to get
 access to features like haptic feedback.
 
 Note how this demo adds KeyboardKit Pro to the main app and
 not its keyboard extensions. This is how KeyboardKit Pro is
 to be added, since it's a binary framework. KeyboardKit has
 to be added to all targets that use it, but KeyboardKit Pro
 only has to be added to the main app.
