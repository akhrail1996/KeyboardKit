/**
 This protocol can be implemented by classes that can define
 styles and appearances for different parts of a keyboard.
 
 KeyboardKit will create a ``StandardKeyboardAppearance`` as
 the keyboard extension is started, then apply this instance
 to ``KeyboardInputViewController/keyboardAppearance``. This
 instance will then be used by default to determine how your
 appearance-based views will look.
 
 If you want to change the style of some buttons or callouts
 or change the the text or image to use for buttons, you can
 implement a custom keyboard appearance.

 You can create a custom implementation of this protocol, by
 inheriting and customizing the standard class or creating a
 new implementation from scratch. When you're implementation
 is ready, just replace the controller service with your own
 implementation to make the library use it instead.
