 This protocol can be used to create text inputs that can be
 used within a keyboard extension.

 A view that inherits this protocol can use its functions to
 easily register and unregister itself as the proxy.

 ``KeyboardTextField`` and ``KeyboardTextView`` implement it
 to let you edit text within a keyboard extension. They both
 set themselves as the current text document proxy when they
 have focus, and reset it when the focus is lost.
